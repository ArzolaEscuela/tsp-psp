## Activity Description
Via project tracking reports, prompt news (in case of bad scenarios), and status reports keep constant (or at least, scheduled) communication with stakeholders regarding the state of the project.

While this is an intended "always running" process, this moment in the sequence is preffered to present progress demos for further feedback.
