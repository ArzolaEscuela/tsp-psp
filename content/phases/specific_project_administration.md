## General Purpose
The purpose of Specific Project Administration, is to define and systematically execute the different core activities that aim to accomplish the project objectives,  all within a pre-established set of budgeted time and overall cost.

## Process Objectives
* Via resource management and intentional team coordination, accomplish all project objectives within a projected cost and time frame.
* Listen to, and accordingly process any feature request or proposition changes from the client, to the project. By pertinent analysis of them as they come.
* Keep the client up-to-date of the project's development progress, via weekly meetings.
* Develop a product while also staying within healthy cost and time estimate thresholds, by the constant gathering of historic metric values that provide a well educated guess on a per-developer, per-activity basis.
* Keep a constant learning curve throughout each iteration of the process, as well as the end of the development cycle, in order to ensure continuous improvement within the team, and the current project's quality.
