    "content": "PSP/TSP Personal Software Process (PSP) is a guide intended for proven-effective, self-disciplined methods, targeted to constantly improving development times, code quality, and overall requirement compliance of an individual’s software development process. Team Software Process (TSP) defines a fundamental draft of skills and knowledge, needed to handle teams composed of PSP trained members, and effectively manage and organize them to produce quality products that meet the functional, architectural, and property requirements. PSP and TSP are intended to provide individuals and teams with a framework for creating or tailoring processes that all team members can follow, for communicating in a common vocabulary, and for planning and tracking their work using a commonly accepted set of measurements and standards. Click on any of the areas above to get more in-depth information. Implementing TSP/PSP can be accomplished by working on three main processes: Direction: Gathers client requirements, creates objectives and goals based on said requirements, and plans for its development. Management: Mainly focusing on team coordination, tool making and provision, resource gathering, and process and project management. Operations: Focuses on the development cycle of concrete software modules or products, and the different mantainability and development tasks for the software. These processes have sub-processes that further delve into their intended end-goal, but ultimately go from project acquisition to development planning to project development (top-to-bottom).",

(Specific) Project Admin: Leadership capacity with experience in the fields of decision making, strategic planning, project, delegation, supervision and personnel management, alongside with finance knowledge and software development knowledge. Process Manager: Placeholder Subcontract Responsible: Project administration experience. Work Team: Each member must be knowledgeable and have experience on their designated area. Software Development and Maintenance Manager: Self explanatory, requires knowdledge and experience developing and giving maintenance to software products. TSP Leader: Team management and leadership skills, count with both PSP and TSP certified training (Note: Could be the same person taking in the role as the specific project administrator). TSP Coach: Have certified training for TSP mentoring, one on one coaching experience, high level communication skills to keep everyone on the loop, and naturally, coaching skills (Which may involve leading members to “fail on their own”). Analyst Knowledge and experience in obtaining, specifying and analysing requirements. User Interface Designer Knowledge in design of user interfaces and ergonomic criteria. Designer Knowledge and experience in designing the structure of the components. Programmer Knowledge and/or experience in programming, integration and unit testing.
